## Introduction

In a traditional ML pipeline, there are many steps involved. We need to explore the dataset, do visualizations to get some insights. Data is cleaned, prepared for processing then feature engineering is done to identify the important features. After this, we train different models on training datasets and, based on model accuracy choose the model and try to increase model accuracy by hyperparameter tuning. Then only we can predict.
Using Auto ML (Automated Machine Learning), we can automate all or some of these intermediary steps. So, the only thing required is data and the rest will be taken care by the Auto ML framework.

We need to divide the data into train test and give it to the frameworks 
We can give time boundation while running.
We will be covering the following frameworks:
- H2O Auto ML
- Auto ViML
- TPOT
- MLBox
- AutoGluon
- MLJAR
- Auto Sklearn
- Auto Keras
- Ludwig
